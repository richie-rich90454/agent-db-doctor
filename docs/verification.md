# Verification

This page is written by the continuous integration workflow itself, not by hand.
After the platform jobs finish on a push to the main branch, the verification job
asks the GitHub API what ran, reads each job's compiler banner back from that
job's log, and commits the result here. A run whose jobs failed writes the page
too, because that is when the record matters most.

A dash in the toolchain column means the job did not get as far as printing its
compiler banner.

The workflow has not run on the main branch yet, so there is no table to show. The
first push that reaches `main` replaces this page with that run's own record.
